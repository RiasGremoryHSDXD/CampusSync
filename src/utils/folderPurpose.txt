Purpose:
This folder contains utility and helper functions that handle logic, data manipulation, or formatting — without any UI.

Examples:
- formatDate.ts for date formatting
- calculateTotal.ts for computations
- validators.ts for input validation

Why:
Keeping logic separate from presentation improves testability and code reuse across multiple components and hooks.
