Purpose:
This folder contains reusable UI components — the building blocks of the interface.

Examples:
- Common components like Button, Input, or Modal
- Layout components like Navbar, Sidebar, or Footer
- Feature-specific components grouped by feature folders

Why:
Components define how the app looks and behaves visually. Keeping them isolated improves reusability and maintainability.
