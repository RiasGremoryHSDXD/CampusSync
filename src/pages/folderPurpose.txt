Purpose:
This folder represents the app’s main screens or routes (e.g., Home, Login, Dashboard).

Examples:
- Home.tsx for the landing page
- Login.tsx for user authentication
- Dashboard/Index.tsx for user-specific data

Why:
Each file in /pages corresponds to a navigable route. This separation keeps navigation logic and page-level composition clear.
