Purpose:
This folder contains all API-related logic such as HTTP requests, data fetching, and backend communication.

Examples:
- apiClient.js or apiClient.ts for base Axios or Fetch configuration
- userApi.ts for user-related endpoints
- productApi.ts for product-related requests

Why:
Centralizing API logic ensures all network requests use consistent headers, error handling, and authentication.
