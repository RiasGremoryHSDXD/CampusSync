Purpose:
This folder defines TypeScript interfaces, types, and data models used across the project.

Examples:
- User.ts for user data structure
- Product.ts for product model
- index.d.ts for shared global types

Why:
Centralizing types improves consistency, reduces duplication, and ensures reliable type-checking across the codebase.
