Purpose:
This folder manages global app state using React Context API.

Examples:
- AuthContext.tsx for authentication state
- ThemeContext.tsx for dark/light mode
- AppContext.tsx for shared UI settings

Why:
Context provides a clean way to share state and functions across multiple components without excessive prop drilling.
